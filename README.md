#### Based from a fork of a  ![React-Chat-App](https://github.com/Sid22031998/React-Chat-App)
#### Features of the Chat App:
<ul>
    <li>Multiple users can connect to the same room and chat.</li>
    <li>The app is based on Snapchat as when you leave the room the messages automatically get deleted.</li>
    <li>The app allows you to send text messages and emojis ;)</li>
    <li>No duplicate users can join the same room which means no two users with the same name can join the same room.</li>
    <li>Multiple rooms can function simultaneously.
    <li>The app is purely based on JS so none of your chat data is saved anywhere. User privacy is important.</li>
</ul>
